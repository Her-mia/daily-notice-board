# Daily Notice Board 
Daily Notice Board is a lightweight Flask-based dashboard that displays countdowns for important events, a live timer, and a weather forecast. It is designed to be simple, expressive, and visually playful. The current version includes a static weather module (set to Wuhan), and future updates will introduce location selection and UI enhancements.
