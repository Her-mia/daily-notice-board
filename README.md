# Daily Notice Board 
Daily Notice Board is a lightweight Flask-based dashboard that displays countdowns for important events, a live timer, and a weather forecast. It is designed to be simple, expressive, and visually playful. The current version includes a static weather module (set to Wuhan), and future updates will introduce location selection and UI enhancements.

The project began with a simple hand‑drawn UI sketch that defined the basic layout: a weather panel at the top, event countdown cards in the middle, and a playful animated car at the bottom. This sketch guided the structure of the final interface.
